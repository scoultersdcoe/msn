## Expected Impacts

*What will change?*

We will increase the number of black and American Indian students who complete Integrated I by the end of 8th grade.

*How will you measure the change?*

We will measure the change by analyzing course taking and comparing rates of students completing Integrated I before and after our intervention.

*Describe your approach to determining impact?*

We plan to establish a threshold for performance and monitor whether we met this threshold after a set amount of time.

*What would you consider a meaningful change?*

A 10% increase in the percentage of black and American Indian students completing Integrated I by June 2022

*How certain do you need to be that this intervention or initiative created the change?*
