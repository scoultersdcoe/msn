## Intervention

To reduce the number of students becoming off track from graduating high school college and career ready, we hypothesized that when adults receive X in the system, the following changes would occur. The following logic model depicts the program theory for the network.
```{r logic-model}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here(
  "images/logic_model.png"
))
```

Our primary questions for determining impact:
*Does a Middle School Network implementing {named intervention} reduce the number of students who become off track from graduating high school ready for college and career?*
